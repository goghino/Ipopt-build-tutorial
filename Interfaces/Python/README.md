# Python's Ipopt Interface
This tutorial covers Python's [cyipopt](https://github.com/matthias-k/cyipopt) interface. Quoting the project's site "_cyipopt is a Python wrapper around Ipopt. It enables using Ipopt from the comfort of the Python programming language._" It is availabe through various package managers, including PyPi, or Anaconda, by default distributed in configuration using Mumps linear solver. Other linear solvers are usually more efficient, here we look on how to set up the interface to use our custom built Ipopt library (covered by tutorial [here](../../Ipopt)).
